In such cases, you can still contribute by sending us any typos, bugs, or improvement suggestions via email to [develop@mathca.app](mailto:develop@mathca.app?subject=MathCA%20APP%20-%20Issue). We appreciate your contributions and strive to make it convenient for users to engage with us, whether through GitHub or alternative communication channels.
